Key Comments:

Developed as a Content Management System for CF Public Library. So primary focus is on the internal organisation with little for external other than seeing the media available. 

a. index.php is for all external users. Would be an external only search file. Not really functional beyond dispaying the current database.

b. employeelogin.php is or would be the login for all employees (not functional right now). More for reference at this point as it needs to be completed with final security.

c. indexcfpublib.php is the homepage for all employees to manage content management system. From there all updates and data inputs can be done.

Folder: mySQLDumpanddatabase is where you find the sql file.

Folder: DatabaseDevelopment are all pdf's for the db creation phase till 3NF.

Was created as a CRUD application. Many create files and then action files are available. 

Thanks,
